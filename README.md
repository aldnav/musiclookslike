Submission for [ChannelFix Hackathon](https://github.com/channelfix/hackathons) Sprint #1 with the focus on JS Canvas.

The application is simple.
It visualizes frequency from audio data using the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
Data plots colored rectangles randomly on a 2x2 matrix. When the time T (30s) is up, it stops and that is how your audio looks
like under T.
